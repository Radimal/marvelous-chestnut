Imagine that you have a patient—let’s say it’s a dog—that has been experiencing persistent vomiting. You take some rads in-house and then send them out to a teleradiology company to get an idea of what’s going on. 

A few days later, you get the radiology report back and immediately start looking for the findings. Before you can get to anything that’s remotely relevant, you need to wade through unnecessary information. The stifles are normal. The hips too. Oh, and there is a microchip.

Yep, you already knew that—you just want to get straight to the pertinent information about why your patient is vomiting so you can identify the best treatment plan. But instead, you waste precious time combing through a radiology report that reads like a medical textbook. 

Sound familiar? It’s a common complaint among vets, and it’s exactly why we made sure our radiology reports here at Radimal are different.

## **Spend less time reading and more time treating**

We don’t believe that a longer report is a better report. A shorter, more concise, and more targeted report gets you the information you need right away so you can spend less time reading and more time treating your patients. 

So, what can you expect to see in our radiology reports? Here’s a quick look at what each one has: 

*   **Case History:** This top section has the nuts and bolts about the patient and their symptoms.

<!---->

*   **Patient Images:** This section includes the submitted X-ray images that were reviewed.

<!---->

*   **Found:** These easy-to-read bars quickly show what was found in the images, and what diseases or issues are likely.

<!---->

*   **Checked:** While we think it’s important to be concise, we also need to be thorough. With Radimal, every single body system is checked and these bars show that—without a ton of unnecessary text for you to read.

<!---->

*   **Clinical Notes:** Finally, this section explains how to interpret the bars and provides recommendations about what next steps should be. 

That’s the breakdown of what you’re looking at. A simplified, actionable report that lets you get right to the must-have and clinically-relevant details and diagnoses.

## **What else makes Radimal’s reports different?**

We think readability is one of the biggest things that separates our reports from the rest. But, there are a few other things we’re also proud of: 

*   **Waiting time:** Or, more accurately, the *lack* of waiting time. Most teleradiology companies take days (or even weeks) to get your reports back to you. Or worse, they promise you a quick turnaround but then you wait for 72 hours for the report. Not with Radimal. Your report will be in your inbox within 48 hours or it’s free.

<!---->

*   **Accessibility:** Have questions about something in your report? Just reply to the email that contains your report. Seriously, that’s it. A boarded radiologist will review your message and get right back to you. You don’t have to wait for your report *or* for answers.

## **Get the answers you need when you need them**

A value-packed radiology report isn’t one that’s pages long. Instead, it’s one that gives you the answers you need as quickly as possible. 

That’s what we kept in mind when creating Radimal and our reports. You deserve accuracy, clarity, and peace of mind—and it doesn’t take walls of text to make that happen.
