## Our top pick for a free, case-based imaging website

[http://www.veterinaryradiology.net/](http://www.veterinaryradiology.net/ "Veterinary Radiology Website")

> Radiology is mostly about pattern recognition. The more you see, the more you know.

This website has it all--

* Cats, dogs, equine, exotic
* Radiographs, ultrasound, CT/MRI
* Variety of skill level

The website is run by Dr. Allison Zwingenberger, who is a veterinary radiologist at the University of California, Davis. 

The website is case-based and has clearly labeled images. You can click to see radiographic findings, diagnoses, AND differentials diagnoses. The list of possible differentials is so valuable because it helps remind you of what the patient could have, not just the "right" answer for that case. Keeping a broad differential list will help prioritize additional diagnostics and treatments in your future patients. Also, if you create an account there is an active "comments" section for each case where you can see what other people thought about the case. These comments are often responded to with helpful tips from a radiologist.

What we love about this site:

* There are real, everyday useful cases on here. It's not filled with zebras or archaic information. 
* The active comments section should encourage you to post your own findings and forces you to justify why you do or don't agree with other people's comments.
* There are SO many cases. This website has been operational since 2007. Your appointment didn't show up? Look at 5 cases and improve your radiology knowledge!
