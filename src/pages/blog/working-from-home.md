## Our top pick for a free, case-based imaging website

[http://www.veterinaryradiology.net/](http://www.veterinaryradiology.net/ "Veterinary Radiology Website")

> Radiology is mostly about pattern recognition. The more you see, the more you know.

This website has it all--

* Cats, dogs, equine, exotic
* Radiographss, ultrasound, CT/MRI
* Variety of skill level

The website is case-based and has clearly labeled images. Then, you can click on the images and see the findings, diagnoses, AND differentials diagnoses. The list of possible differentials is so valuable because it helps remind you of what the patient could have, not just the "right" answer for that case. Keeping a broad differential list will help prioritize additional diagnostics and treatments in your patients.
