As a radiologist for over a decade, I have a personal understanding of the juggling act clinicians perform every day. Between seeing appointments, running and interpreting diagnostics, managing clients, callbacks, and procedures...our days are hectic. Add to that the mental load of the cases we take home with us: Did I miss a lung nodule? Should I have started that coughing cat on antibiotics? I’ve been there. Teleradiology has opened up access to a radiologist for everyone, but waiting for radiology reports can be prohibitive when it comes to making on the spot clinical decisions. That’s why we developed Radimal. We provide the clinical information your patient needs and the peace of mind that you deserve.

> Radimal will give you the clinical information that your patient needs and the peace of mind that you deserve. Our technology is there to support you - quickly and reliably - in interpreting your radiographs, enabling you to treat your patients quickly and with confidence.
