        title: Radiology Reports Delivered in Minutes with Artificial Intelligence
        content: >-
          Say hello to reports in minutes (not days) that can help inform
          patient treatment for vets of all experience levels. If it looks
          normal to you, you'll know if it looks normal to Radimal too. If the
          patient needs treatment immediately, you'll have extra insights for
          that just as quickly.

      What motivates us the most is seeing the difference that Radimal makes for
      real vets every day, whether it's saving a patient's life or saving a
      vet's time. Radimal works for vets because it was designed by vets.

          It's great to have that peace of mind to know that Radimal is
          verifying that something is normal or not. That's every vet's greatest
          fear - that you're missing something. Radimal helps me know that we're
          giving the best possible medicine to our patients.

          I was surprised at how fast it was. and the techs didn't even have to
          do anything additional. Whether you already use teleradiology or not,
          Radimal reports are so immediate. You want to talk about results in
          the office while the patient is there, in real time, and now you can.

          Before co-founding Radimal I was aware of the growing use of AI in our
          industry but didn't fully appreciate its impact and benefit to patient
          care. Now, I get to talk to vets every day who share their stories
          about how Radimal reports make a difference to them, their patients
          and their owners. This is a gamechanger and I'm excited for DVMs and
          DACVRs like me to experience it.
