    title: Radiology Reports Delivered in Minutes with Artificial Intelligence
    content: Say hello to reports in minutes (not days) that can help inform patient
      treatment for vets of all experience levels. If it looks normal to you, you'll
      know if it looks normal to Radimal too. If the patient needs treatment immediately,
      you'll have extra insights for that just as quickly.

  title: Made With Vets, Great For Vets
  subtitle: What motivates us the most is seeing the difference that Radimal makes
    for real vets every day, whether it's saving a patient's life or saving a vet's
    time. Radimal works for vets because it was designed by vets.

    content: It's about having that comfort and knowing that Radimal is verifying
      that something is normal. That's every vet's greatest fear - that you're missing
      something. So this helps you know that you're providing the best care to your
      patients.

    content: Before helping co-found Radimal, I had learned about the role of AI in
      our industry but didn't fully understand its capability or impact. After a long
      period of R&D, we finally got to see the reports go out. After hearing the amazing
      feedback from the DVMs who helped us with early stage testing, I knew immediately
      this would be a gamechanger in our industry.
