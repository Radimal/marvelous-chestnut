      What motivates us the most is seeing the difference that Radimal makes for
      real vets every day, whether it's saving a patient's life or saving a
      vet's time. Radimal works for vets because it was designed by vets.

          It's great to have that peace of mind to know that Radimal is
          verifying if something is normal or not. That's every vet's greatest
          fear - that you're missing something. Radimal helps me know that we're
          giving the best possible medicine to our patients.

          I was surprised at how fast it was and the techs didn't even have to
          do anything additional. Whether you already use teleradiology or not,
          Radimal reports are so immediate. I want to discuss results in the
          office while the patient is there, in real time, and now I can.

          Before co-founding Radimal I was aware of the growing use of AI in our
          industry but didn't fully appreciate its impact and benefit to patient
          care. Now, I get to talk to vets every day who share their stories
          about how Radimal reports make a difference to them, their patients
          and their owners. This is a gamechanger and I'm excited for DVMs and
          DACVRs like me to experience it.
