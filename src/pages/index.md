        title: Radiology Reports Delivered in Minutes
        content: >-
          Say hello to reports in minutes (not days!) that can help inform
          patient treatment for vets of all experience levels. If it looks
          normal to you, you'll know in minutes if it looks normal to Radimal
          too. If the patient needs treatment immediately, you'll have extra
          insights for that just as quickly.

      The most exciting part of what we do is seeing the impact it has on real
      vets every day. Whether it's saving a patient treatment decision or saving
      time, we believe it works because vets tell us it works.

          Having that comfort and knowing that somebody is verifying that
          something is normal. that's every vet's greatest fear -- that you're
          missing something. So this helps you know that you're giving the best
          medicine to your patients.
